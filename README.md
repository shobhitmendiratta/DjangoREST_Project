# Profiles REST API

Accomplished the development of a comprehensive REST API utilizing Python and the Django REST framework. Through this endeavor, I engineered an operational API capable of facilitating user profile creation, updates, deletions, and management, alongside authentication functionality through usernames and passwords. This involved mastery of local development server administration, implementation of Django models for database creation, utilization of Django admin for object management, and proficient deployment of the application on AWS infrastructure.
